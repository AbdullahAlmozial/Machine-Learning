In this project, I have applied unsupervised learning techniquesto identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany ,these segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. 

##### Project: Finding Donors for CharityML
In this project, we will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. our goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.
